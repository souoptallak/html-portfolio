 <h1>The best movies according to Patrick</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Prostituee cherie</h3>
 <p>My best movie because it paints real life.One of my favorite movies is Prostitute Cherie from Orimo TV. It’s a bold and emotional story that dives deep into themes of survival, identity, and love in unexpected places. What really stands out to me is the raw storytelling and how the main character, Cherie, shows strength and vulnerability in a world that often tries to silence her. It’s a film that stays with you and makes you think long after it ends.

 </p>
 <h3>Derriere le masque from Blaise Ntedju</h3>
 <p>really cool movie to watch.Derrière le Masque by Blaise Ntedju is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores the hidden emotions and struggles people often keep behind a façade. The storytelling is deep and reflective, revealing how appearances can hide pain, hope, and truth. What I admire most about the film is its emotional depth and how it encourages viewers to look beyond the surface—to see the real stories behind the “mask.</p>
 <h3>Femme cupide</h3>
 <p>Super beautiful film.Really artistic.Femme Cupide is a gripping and intense film that sheds light on the consequences of greed and manipulation in relationships. The story follows a woman whose desire for wealth leads her down a dangerous and emotional path. What makes this movie stand out is how it mixes drama with realism, showing how choices driven by selfish motives can affect everyone involved. It’s a cautionary tale that really makes you reflect.
